![Board and Housing](photos/Board%20and%20Grey%20Housing.jpg)

## Cartridge board and Housing for [ATARI 65XE/130XE/800XE/800XL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family) 8-bit computers based on [SST39SF040](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/SST39SF040) CMOS multi-purpose **Flash memory** chip.

- This is a **[S/XEGS type cartridge](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/276194-switchable-xe-game-cartridges-swxegs-andor-sxegs/)** that allows you to store and run dozens of games.
- The project **does not use** programmable logic chips such as [GAL-chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_array_logic).
- Only conventional logic chips are used, such as **74LS00N**, **74LS74N** and **74LS374N**.
- In the process of manufacturing a cartridge, microchips of Russian production can be used, such as **ЭКР1533ИР23**, **К555ТМ2**, **К555ЛА3** etc.

The ROM files for the cartridge are created from the XEX files using the [CreaXin1](http://chomikuj.pl/ccwrc/users/XEGS/x_angel_ccwrc_atari_custom_cart,6059920787.7z(archive)) utility,
and then merged using the [XEGS Merger](http://chomikuj.pl/ccwrc/users/XEGS/x_angel_ccwrc_atari_custom_cart,6059920787.7z(archive)) to combine four files into one, forming a total of 512 kb of ROM memory.

The cartridge body consists of two 3D-printed parts. The parts connect to each other without the use of screws or glue.
